* Date - The date of the observation
* AveragePrice - The average price of a single avocado
* Type - Conventional or organic

* Region - The city or region of the observation
* Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
* 4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
* 4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold

### Price Elasticity Interpretation

| Elasticity          | Interpretation        |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Ed > 1              | Elastic Demand        |
| Ed = 1              | Unitary Elastic Demand|
| Ed < 1              | Inelastic Demand      |
